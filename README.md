# Alien vs. Zombie

Alien vs Zombies is a game where it combines puzzle, path-planning and strategy into the mix to bring unique gameplay experience. Players must eliminate the zombies by cleverly 
navigating the aliens on a path to destroy the zombies before the zombies destroyed the players. Players will face other object that could aid or hinder the player such as pod, 
health and rock. Every move counts, and only with correct strategizing and moves will only the player be able to beat all the zombies and claim victory.
